### 1.The Auric Singularity (SCP-XXXX)
**Videography** : 

**Object Class:** Keter  

**Special Containment Procedures:**  
SCP-XXXX is to be housed in a reinforced underground vault constructed from tungsten and lead composites. No direct line of sight is permitted—observation must be conducted through filtered imaging sensors to prevent anomalous cognitive effects. The chamber is to be bathed in high-frequency electromagnetic fields at all times, disrupting the object’s expanding influence. Any personnel experiencing golden visual distortions or intrusive thoughts related to "ascension" are to be quarantined immediately.  

**Description:**  
SCP-XXXX, known as *The Auric Singularity*, is a rotating mass of spiraling golden luminescence, suspended within an undetectable gravitational field. The object radiates an intricate fractal pattern of swirling arcs, forming an ever-shifting vortex that appears both infinite and impossibly confined within a fixed radius.   

When observed directly, SCP-XXXX induces an overwhelming sense of reverence and fixation in all sentient beings. Prolonged exposure leads to hallucinations of celestial voices whispering in an unknown dialect, urging the observer toward "sublimation" into the light. Victims who remain within close proximity for extended periods (typically beyond 48 hours) undergo complete neurological breakdown, their bodies transmuting into a metallic dust composed of previously unknown elements.  

**Discovery:**  
First detected in 1986, SCP-XXXX was located deep within an abandoned temple complex beneath the sands of the Sahara. An archeological team investigating the ruins vanished without a trace, with only a single recorded transmission recovered: *"We have seen it. The light is warm. We go willingly."*  

Foundation agents retrieved SCP-XXXX after encountering a massive crater where the temple once stood. At the center of the void, the spiraling golden sphere hovered, untouched by time. Attempts to measure its mass, energy output, or spectral composition have yielded impossible results, with data fluctuating wildly as if the object exists in a superposition of states.  

**Incident XXXX-07:**  
On ██/██/████, an unauthorized experiment was conducted by Dr. ██████, who disabled the electromagnetic dampeners and entered SCP-XXXX’s chamber alone. Surveillance footage shows him standing before the anomaly, whispering incomprehensibly before extending his hand toward the vortex. Within moments, his form distorted—elongating, breaking apart into particles of radiant dust, which were then absorbed into SCP-XXXX. The object's glow intensified momentarily before stabilizing.  

Since the incident, the radius of SCP-XXXX’s effect has expanded by approximately 0.03%, leading to speculation that it consumes biological matter to sustain or increase its influence.  

**Current Hypothesis:**  
The Auric Singularity is believed to be either a fragment of an extraterrestrial intelligence or a self-replicating artifact designed by an unknown civilization. Some Foundation researchers theorize that it is not merely an object but a *door*—one leading beyond human comprehension, to a place where matter and consciousness cease to exist independently.  

Attempts to communicate with SCP-XXXX have resulted in cryptic electromagnetic bursts, resembling patterns found in deep-space signals cataloged by the ██████ Observatory. Some translations suggest a repeating phrase:  

*"YOU ARE NOT YET READY."*
